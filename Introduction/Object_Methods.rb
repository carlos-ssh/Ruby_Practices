***************** Object Methods *********************

INSTRUCTIONS:

Each object in Ruby may have methods associated with it. To demonstrate this, we want you to print whether a number is even or odd. A number has an even? method associated with it, which returns true or false based on the parity of the number.
Assuming a variable number is already defined, check whether a given number is even or not.

=end

def odd_or_even(number)

    # add your code here
    if number += 2
      return number.even?
    end
end

(0...gets.to_i).each do |i|
    puts odd_or_even(gets.to_i)
end
