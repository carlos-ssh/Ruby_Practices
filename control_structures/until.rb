            Ruby Control Structures - Until
INSTRUCTIONS:

This challenge has a beautiful one-liner answer.
"A hacker practices on HackerRank until getting to a rating of O(1) read as (Oh-one)"
Call the method coder.practice until coder.oh_one? becomes true.
Use the until control structure.
until is the logical equivalent of while not.

    
=end

coder.practice until coder.oh_one?
