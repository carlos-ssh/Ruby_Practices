********************* INITIALIZATION ************************

INSTRUCTIONS:

One of the most commonly used data structures in Ruby is a Ruby Array, and below we see various methods of initializing a ruby array.
Your task is to initialize three different variables as explained below.
Initialize an empty array with the variable name array
Hint:

array = Array.new
or

array = []
Initialize an array with exactly one nil element in it with the variable name array_1
Hint:

array_1 = Array.new(1)
or

array_1 = [nil]
Initialize an array with exactly two elements with value 10 in it using the variable name array_2.
Hint

array_2 = Array.new(2, 10)
or

array_2 = [10, 10]

=end

# Initialize 3 variables here as explained in the problem statement
array = Array.new
array_1 = Array.new(1)
array_2 = Array.new(2, 10)
